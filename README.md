### Erebus tmTheme

A [TextMate][1] _(and [Sublime Text][4])_ theme based on [Monokai][2] by [Wimer Hazenberg][3].

Erebus is a warm theme with an autumn'ish feel. Mainly tested for use with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but should work fine with most languages.

I was working on a pack to fit the seasons, but haven't come up with anything other than this theme that I'm happy with. Maybe in the future :]

___Note__: this theme was only tested in [Sublime Text][4]. It should be fully compatible with [TextMate][1], but if you come across any errors, please report them and I'll do my best to fix them._
